# Severstal (steel manufacturing company) hackaton March 2022
## 🔥As a team member of "JEDAI" our team took 3rd place🔥


## **Task**
 
- Data analysis of given data, contractors debt prediction, feature generation;  
- As result: understandable for the analyst, for the business owner Jupyter Notebook with detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and reproductible code of EDA, feature generation, ML, outputs;  
- Overall, this task had an "open answer". Each team could choose it's own metric. The main challenge was to explain why particulary we used this metrics from business point of view. We decided to use simultaneously 5 metrics: **recall, precision, accuracy, roc-auc on test, confusion matrix. The best combination of these 5 metrics gave as the best ML model.**

## **Structure of the repository**
- EDA.ipynb - Jupyter notebook with EDA;  
- Fact_PDZ_prediction.ipynb - Jupyter notebook with ML for contractors debt prediction;  
- PDZ_prediction_30_days_and_60_90.ipynb - Jupyter notebook with ML for contractors debt prediction within certain time window: 30 days, from 60 to 90 days;  
- my_functions.py - py file with self-made functions;   
- severstal_04_main.zip - zip file with all data: internal dataframes, all jupyter notebooks, py files. Just download it. Unzip. And it's ready for work!💯💪🌟    
- Final_presentation.pdf - final presentation of our team ("JEDAI");   
- jedai_final pitch.mp4 - final pitch.

## **What was done**
- Join of 3 files. Each files contatins diffrent amount of fetures (3 years. Each year company used more features);    
- EDA: box plots, clustering, correlation matrix between features;  
- ML to predict a contractors with debt or w/o debt;    
- ML to predict contractors debt within certain time window: 30 days, from 60 to 90 days.  


## **Lesson learned (what we could do more)**
- The main reason why we didn't achieve the 1st place😏 was a not enough evaluation of business effect of our modelling. 

## **🔥Diploma of the 3rd place🔥**
